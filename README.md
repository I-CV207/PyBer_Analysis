# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
With the provided data about the amount of rides within a range of time and general data about 120 cities with presence of ride sharing service,  the task at hand is to organize, clasify and analyse the data by city type in order to come with conclusions about the performance and future development of the ride sharing service within this type of cities.

## Results
The given data was classififed and transformed to see it by city type as seen in the images below. Based on the results shown on the table (PyBer Summary by City Type) and in the graph (Total Fare By City Type) the following points are worth mention:

***PyBer Summary by City Type*** 

- The city type with the greater count of rides is *Urban* with 1,625 rides followed by *Suburban* with 625 rides and in third place *Rural* with 125 rides, meaning that *Urban* cities have almost 3 times more rides that *Suburban* cities and 13 times more rides than in *Rural* cities.

- When it comes to drivers in each city type, *Urban* cities have 2,450 drivers, in second place *Suburban* cities with 490 drivers and lastly *Rural* cities with 78 drivers, this means that aproximately 81% percent of the drivers operate in *Urban* cities, 16% in *Suburban* cities and only 3% are in *Rural* cities.

- The total revenue from fares in *Urban* cities is also grater that in the other city types, is 2 times grater than *Suburban* cities and it is 9 times grater than in *Rural* cities.

- The average fare per Ride is greater in *Rural* cities ($34.62) probably due to the fact that are greater distances that a driver has to drive to reach its location than in *Suburban* cities ($30.97) and also *Urban* cities ($24.53).

- Looking at the average fare per driver, *Rural* cities have an average of $55.49, followed by *Suburban* with $39.50 and lastly *Urban* cities with an average of $16.57, which means that a driver that operates in a *Rural* city gets in average 1.4 times the revenue than a driver from a *Suburban* city and 3 times the revenue than one from an *Urban* city.

***Total Fare By City Type (Jan 2019 - April 2019)***

- Looking at the graph we can see that *Urban* cities have earn most of the revenue from fares throught the first 5 months of 2019 within a range between 1500-2500 USD per week, *Suburban* cities generate a weekly revenue from fares between a range of 700 - 1500 USD and *Rural* cities earn between 50 - 500 USD per week.
- We can see that during the last week of February all 3 city types have one of their bests if not, the best week when it comes to earnings from fares, probably due to the fact that there was a holiday during that week thay may have caused the increase of demand.

## Summary

Based on the results, the following recommendations are given to address disparities among the city types:

1. Relocate drivers from Urban cities to nearby Suburban and Rural cities as the results show that in these type of cities there are more rides than drivers.
2. Adjust fare prices to make it more atractive for customers in Suburban and Rural cities, as this type of cities usually have a higher average fare per ride probably due to      the greater distances that they need to cover.
3. Special and attractive fares during periods of high demand to increase the use of the ride sharing service, specially in Suburban and Rural cities.
